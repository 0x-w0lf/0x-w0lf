## 🏗️ My Engineering Vision
- **Architecture & Product Leadership**: I approach software design with a product-oriented mindset, balancing technical depth and business value. My experience spans monoliths, microservices, and distributed systems in cloud-native environments.  
- **Security by Design**: As a Security Champion, I integrate security as a pillar of the development lifecycle, applying industry best practices and proactive risk mitigation strategies.  
- **Mentorship & Growth**: I lead through mentorship, measurable goals, and clear metrics. I believe in growing people alongside systems, aligning team development with strategic business objectives.  
- **Software Craftsmanship**: My development philosophy is based on clean code, continuous improvement, and assertive code reviews that focus on solving problems—not on unnecessary stylistic debates.
